# Training Dojo
A repo to help a friend get back to the field exploring Git, Docker, Vagrant, Ruby, PHP, Wordpress, Rails...

The idea is to add some very short steps that can be completed alone in a short period of time. The steps should talk by themselves and not have any dense readings. No need to inter connect the knowledge with the hope that the pieces will get interconnected by themselves with time falling in place like a tetris game.

Anyone is free to contribute polishing the steps, proposing new ones, etc. Pull requests are more than welcomed.
