# Welcome to Github.com

Create a [Github](https://github.com) account, and a new repository in it. Feel free to name the repository at your own will.

Create a file named README.md at the repository and add this content to it.

```
# Starting point

Starting by the first step.
```

Commit the file and take a look at the repository.

Take the chance to explore a bit Github.com and see if you can find materials to learn a bit about Git.

Don't worry, we will work more on it as we progress.
