# Installing Git for Windows

Install [Git for Windows (MINGW64)](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

Explore a bit the terminal. Note that the `\` is different than Windows.

Run the `pwd` command and check the result. It tells you at what path you are. Note that the `C:` maps to `/c`.

Run the `ls` command to see the contents of the current folder. Check the `ls -la` command. 

Mind that any folder started with `.` will not be shown at `ls` but will show at the `ls -la`.

If you still have some time explore which common commands from linux are available at MINGW terminal. Check some commands at [10 commands](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands)

Check shortcuts (I really like the Ctrl+R and arrows) and system info [here](https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/244).

If you are still having fun, search in Google for the Grep command. It will be very useful down the road. Take also a look at linux pipe `|`.

Try this command and see if you can understand it:

```
find | grep exe
```

What about this:

```
grep step * -r
```
